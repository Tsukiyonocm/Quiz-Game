## Quiz Game ##
  
##### Expected Start/End Times #####
**Start Date**: 7/01/18
**End Date**: 12/31/18


#####  Project Preview #####
Follwing in a basic setup of giving a question with four multiple choice questions. The user will be given 10 seconds in order to answer the question. Upon completion a score will be tallied for the user. 

Technology to be used (not fully inclusive yet):

Html/Css
Javascript (vanilla)
MongoDb? (eventually perhaps. need to understand databases more first)
React (would be version 2 of the app, initially will be all in Vanilla JS)


#####  Guidelines #####
1. Basic logic thoughts on category selection. The javascript will loop through the array/object and look through the questions to pull out the category IDs of each subset of questions. 

This will create a simple card display which will list all the categories list and awaiting the user to click the choice. Two will be the starting point but will be expanded upon in the future.

##### Todo List #####
Step 1:

~~1. Institute basic logic for the questions array object.~~

~~2. Setup github repo for initial commit.~~

~~3. Create branch for initial game selection screen "Choose a category". Branch name will be category selection.~~

~~4. Create basic html/css layout for category selection. This will not be a finalized version of the design but will be enough to get the idea across and make sure the logic works within JS for pulling the list of categories out of the JS object.~~

5. Create thought outline on the project. Steps to go through to completion as well as thinking out each step in Readme and blog posting.
